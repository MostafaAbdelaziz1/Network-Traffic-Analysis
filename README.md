# Network-Traffic-Analysis

## Objective:
To create a tool that detects ARP Spoofing attacks in real-time, providing alerts to enhance network security.

## Background:
ARP Spoofing attacks involve malicious actors sending falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local network. This results in the linking of the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network, leading to potential data interception and unauthorized access.

Features of the ARP Spoofer Detector:

  1. Real-Time Monitoring:

    - Continuously monitors ARP traffic within the network.
    - Identifies discrepancies between known IP-MAC pairs and incoming ARP messages.

  2. Detection Algorithms:

    - Static Detection: Compares ARP responses with a predefined list of legitimate IP-MAC pairs.

  3. Alerting Mechanisms:

    - Sends immediate notifications via email, SMS, or network alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
    - Logs detailed information about the potential attack, including timestamp, source, and affected devices.

  4. Integration:

    - Can be integrated with existing network management and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
    - Supports various network architectures and can be deployed on multiple platforms.


By developing this ARP Spoofer Detector, which is simple one :), aims to strengthen our network defenses and provide a detecting and responding to ARP Spoofing attacks in real-time.
