# Network-Traffic-Analysis

Objective: To create a tool that detects ARP Spoofing attacks in real-time, providing alerts to enhance network security.

Background:
ARP Spoofing attacks involve malicious actors sending falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local network. This results in the linking of the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network, leading to potential data interception and unauthorized access.

Features of the ARP Spoofer Detector:

Real-Time Monitoring:

Continuously monitors ARP traffic within the network.
Identifies discrepancies between known IP-MAC pairs and incoming ARP messages.
Detection Algorithms:

Static Detection: Compares ARP responses with a predefined list of legitimate IP-MAC pairs.
Dynamic Detection: Builds a dynamic table of legitimate pairs based on observed network traffic, flagging anomalies.
Alerting Mechanisms:

Sends immediate notifications via email, SMS, or network alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
Logs detailed information about the potential attack, including timestamp, source, and affected devices.
User Interface:

Provides a dashboard to view real-time ARP traffic.
Displays alerts and logs for easy review and analysis.
Integration:

Can be integrated with existing network management and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
Supports various network architectures and can be deployed on multiple platforms.


By developing this ARP Spoofer Detector, which is simple one :), aims to strengthen our network defenses and provide a detecting and responding to ARP Spoofing attacks in real-time.
